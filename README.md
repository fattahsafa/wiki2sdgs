Predicting Poverty Level using Geolocated Wikipedia Articles
==============

## Motivation
Current efforts to measure the progress of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are hampered by a dearth of data. 
For example, poverty — one of seventeen SDGs — is not measured often because it is both spatially sparse and infrequently collected in Sub-Saharan Africa due to the high cost of surveys.
Same for Syria and Iraq, due to the war. One possible way to measure these indicators is making use of the open texts available in Web.
In this project, we are trying to use the Wikipedia articles attached to specific locations to predict the povert level. 
We demonstrate that modern NLP techniques can be used to predict community-level asset Wikipedia articles.
